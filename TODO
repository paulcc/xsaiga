Important
---------

More case studies





Not so important
----------------

More conventional packaging
	(eg using Cabal, identifying a place in the library hierarchy, 
	some automatic test cases, ...)

Improving the documentation

Experimenting with different table types 
	(seems: lazy maps are comparable with stricter arrays)

Revise the classes that manage semantic details
	(we need to look at a few more applications and look at the
	attribute grammar mechanism before we settle on this.)

Generalise the monad support
	(we don't expand all sharing yet, so monad laws only hold for
	non-packed examples; but unpacking will be expensive, so more
	thought needed here.)
